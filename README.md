# MoodleNet Project

[MoodleNet](https://moodle.com/moodlenet) is a new open social media platform for educators, focussed on professional development and open content. It will be an integral part of the Moodle ecosystem. This is the home of the project, hosted on a wiki, and will be updated as the project develops.

The source code and issue tracking for MoodleNet will be [hosted elsewhere](https://gitlab.com/moodlenet).
